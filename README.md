# My Final Fantasy XIV Furniture App

## Hey everybody!

Based off the suggestion of Danny Thompson, a software developer on Twitter who makes every effort to support and encourage junior developers, I started working on this modest furniture app based on a limited database of furniture items in the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV.

## How I started

In a previous tutorial project, I used Contentful as my CMS to store info about hotel rooms, so I replicated that functionality to use in my furniture app. Using their API was simple and intuitive. I stored several items with the categories of type, price, ID, etc., knowing that eventually I wanted the app to sort by these criteria.

## What I learned

I learned SO much! File organization, how to properly use reducers/hooks/custom hooks, useState vs useContext, using various Tailwind and Material-Tailwind components, and even simple things such as reviewing array methods on deeply nested keys/values.

Some specific things that I had a hard time with, that I hope I won't forget any time soon:

1. Reducers are pure functions and have to return something!
2. Named and default exports are different!
3. The second parameter in the useEffect hook is important!

## If I had more time, I would...

Add a little more functionality such as a faux checkout system with Stripe or something similar, redoing the design to be a little brighter or similar to its videogame inspiration, and/or add a slider for price range.

## What I'd do differently

I read in a recent freeCodeCamp article that design and functionality should come first in professional workflows. Next time, I would definitely think about coding around a pre-defined design from a hypothetical design department. Luckily, I had thought about my app's functionality from the very beginning, so I did not struggle too much with what it should do so much as *how* it should do it.

Anyway, thanks for reading! Let me know what you think by emailing me at jetuala@gmail.com.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
